PyBossa Landfill application
============================

This demo application shows how you can analyze a Landfills
in a PyBossa server like CrowdCrafting.org.

The application is a simple demo that uses OpenLayers JavaScript library to load a map,
center it and add one or more points/polygons to the map. 

Thanks to the use of OpenLayers the data can be exported in any standard GIS format:
KML, GeoJSON, etc. In this application the answers are saved as GeoJSON.

The application has three files:

*  createTasks.py: for creating the application in PyBossa
*  template.html: the view for every task and deal with the data of the answers.
*  tutorial.html: a simple tutorial for the volunteers.

Testing the application:
=======================
You need to install the pybossa-client and the soundcloud client (use a virtualenv):

```bash
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*  Create an account in PyBossa
*  Copy under your account your API-KEY
*  Run python createTasks.py -u http://crowdcrafting.org -k API-KEY
*  Open with your browser the *Applications section* and choose the MapKnitter
   application. This will open the presenter for this demo application.
